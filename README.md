# README

Table Talk is an online campaign manager for table top role-playing games (TTRPGs). It allows you to create, run, and play in games of any system (Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, and beyond!)

## Features

### Accounts

Users can sign up for an account with an email address or using Google.

### Campaigns

Any user who wants to be a Game Master (GM) can create a new campaign, which they have managing power of. Users who want to participate in games as Players can join any public campaign from the public list, or join a private campaign if the GM has sent them a link.

### Characters

Players can join a campaign by creating a character for it. Don't worry - if you want to join a game but haven't completely fleshed out your character concept yet, you can always go back and edit it! Players can see a list of all their characters on their profile page.

### Sessions

GMs can schedule sessions for their campaigns so everyone in the game knows when they'll be getting together to play. Each campaign has a calendar of sessions, and users can see their personal schedules across all their games on their profile page. For the scheduling feature, Table Talk uses the [simple_calendar](https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar) gem.

### Notes

If you're tired of keeping track of game events in a physical notebook, you can leave notes on your campaigns instead! Use notes to keep track of game events, ask questions, or chat with your fellow players.
